	  1. https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This projects goal is to create a new 3d rendering system that will allow for lower end devices to run 3d games.<br>
	  I considered this project because I personally enjoy playing games and understand the struggle of low fps,<br>
	  but rejected it because I have no experience in making such an project and have plans for my own ISP.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  2.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/lilly-seeley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This projects goal is to make an app that allows the user to easily make travel plans. This project seems simple enough,<br> but I think it will be an interesting challenge. I considered this project because I like the idea of making an app,<br>
	  but decided against it because it would require a lot of research and I have plans to join a different project.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  3.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophia-tran/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This project is an app that books online reservations at resturants without the need to call the resturant.<br>
	  I considered this project because I too, dislike calling up resturants to make reservations. I did not join however,<br>due to previous plans to work on another project.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  4.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/stefano-giron/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This projects goal is to make a tower defense game, a game where you make use of towers and upgrades to defend against<br>oncoming waves of enemies. I enjoy these kinds of games a lot, so I immediately considered joining this project.
	  5.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This projects goal is to make a "Symptoms Quiz" which will help you find out how sick you are, Similar to looking<br>
	  on google for a diagnosis. This seems like a fun projects to make but will require a lot of research.
	  6.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This project is a code converter. It will take in code and convert it into other programming languages. This project<br> seems very challenging and will require a lot of knowledge and research of numerous programming languages. I considered this<br> one becuase of the challenging aspect.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  7.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zachary-chandler/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br> This project aims to create a "souls like game". Souls like games are known to be very difficult games where you fight <br>
	  enemies and challenging bosses. I considered joining in this project because I have played Elden Ring, one of my<br>
	  favorite games that just so happens to be a souls like game.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  9.https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html<br>
	  This project is similar to the above project. Its goal is to organize school activities and clubs. I considred this one <br> for the same reasons as the one above.
	  <br>
	  <br>
