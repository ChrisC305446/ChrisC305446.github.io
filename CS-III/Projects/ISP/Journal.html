	This page is dedicated to documenting the progress of my ISP Project. Here I will describe the challenges we faced each week while developing the project, including technical, scheduling, and interpersonal challenges.
      </p>
      <h3 class="w3-text-white">Project Roles</h3>
      <p><b>SoftWare Engineer</b><br>
	    Development Engineer (Front End) — The role of the "Development Engineer" is designing, creating and testing new products for the companies. Like problem-solvers, they work out why something does not work, and then make it work again.
	Development Engineer (Back End) — The role of the back-end developmental engineer is to make sure that the code is efficient, stable, and works as intended. They also have the job of making sure that the system is secure and can't be back doored.
	This role will be taken by Evan Bowerman
	    <br><br>
      <b>QA Engineer</b><br>
	QA Engineers are specialists whose activities are focused on improving the software development process by detecting errors. Additionally, they focus on preventing said errors from happening again.Tests the products to find any bugs or errors in the product. Ensures that the product is good        for the customer and to make sure that the specifications are adhered to by the product.This role will be taken by Christopher Carter<br><br>
      <b>Product Manager</b><br>
         The product manager controls product planning, and should have a detailed perception for what the final product should look like. The product manager should check in with all other roles to ensure progress is being made, and specializes in features that will be present in the application.          Furthermore, the product manager also works with the project manager to ensure that the team follows a structured timeline so that the application can be finished when it is due.This role will be taken by Christopher Carter<br><br>
      <b>Project Manager</b><br>
      The project manager is responsible for the planning and overseeing of the timeline and maximizes efficiency in the team through organization. They verify that the product is completed in a satisfactory manner and is ready for release. It is important to make sure everyone is doing their part       correctly.This role will be taken by Evan Bowerman.<br><br>
      <b>Realease Manager</b><br>
      The Release Manager is responsible for implementing and managing release processes for code through development, test, and production environments. This role focuses on coordinating different aspects of production into the overall product.This role will be taken by Andrew Liu.

 <b>Technical Challenges</b>
With the game becoming more and more complex, it its becoming more difficult to keep track of all of the scripts and code. I have been making strides to document and organize the code in the engine. Additionally, the engine recently got an update to 4.0,meaning soon we will have to debugg the project if we ever switch over. We will stay on the older version for now though. <br> 
<b>Interpersonal Challenges</b>
 Some of our team members have been absent a lot recently, meaning it has been difficut to work with them on the project. That paired with our other team member being in a different class means it is rather difficult to get stuff done. <br>
  <b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
 I have been getting more hours at my part time job recently, and the rest of the team seems to be either too busy, or asleep when I get home from work, meaning there is not a lot of time to work on the project with them.
<h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>18-Feb-2023<b/></h5>
<b>Technical Challenges</b>
This week we rehuauled the attacking system, replacing the static hitbox with an animated sprite with an actual moving sword and hitbox. This was a challenge due to the rotation of the object relative to the player.<br>
<b>Interpersonal Challenges</b>
    We started using Vscode to push and pull from Godot, as this was easier than the built in Github feature in Godot, which required more communication between members.<br>
<b>Scheduling Challenges<b>
    
  
<h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>10-Feb-2023<b/></h5>
<b>Technical Challenges</b>
This week we continued developement of the basic functions of the game, including character movement, lighting, enemy projectiles, and attack states. A main challenge was working with the animation player. It can be finnicky to work with and requires a lot of sprite work to make look decent.<br>
<b>Interpersonal challenges<b>
    A challenge we had was getting everyone up to speed on the godot and the pushing and pulling process.<br>
<b>Scheduling Challenges<b>
I have been working late into the night during the week, and using discord to communicate on the project.

	
	 <h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>27-Jan-2023<b/></h5>
	<b>Techincal Challenges</b>
	This week we started the main development of the game. Using python and the built in GD-Script that Godot uses, we created a few basic rooms ofthe game, as well as the Title Screen. In order to do this we used the Godot documentation pages that define functions and propeties within the engine.<br>
	<b>Interpersonal Challenges</b>
	Dividing up the work was the first interpersonal challange we faced. We first started working on the parts of the game we agreed upon in the issues section, and each worked independantly on each feature.<br>
	<b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
	I got a new laptop that would allow me to work on the project at school, so I was on longer restricted to working solely at home after work. This made it much easier to progress through developement.<br>
	<h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>12-Jan-2023<b/></h5>
	     <b>Technical Challenges</b><br>
	     Figuring out how to use godot and implementing a suitable UI and map generating system.<br>
	     <b>Scheduling Challenges</b><br>
	     Balancing work on the project and other classes, as well as deciding who should work on what aspect of the game.<br>
	     <b>Interpersonal Challenges</b><br>
	     We needed to decide who would be working on what aspect of the game, we took some time to select who would do what issue.<br> 
	    <h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>6-Jan-2023<b/></h5>
	      <b>Technical Challenges</b><br>
	       Since starting the project we have only encoutnered a few technical challenges. Finding the right engine to create the game on was one of them. We ultimately decided on the Godot engine. Another challange was setting up github repositoriesso we could all work on the game. <br>
	       <b>Scheduling Challenges</b><br>
	       Finding time to work on the project is very challenging. Outside of school I work a parttime job, so I do not have much free time. I try to work in class as much as possible to combat this.<br>
	      <b> Interpersonal challenges</b><br>
	       The only interpersonal challange we have faced was one of our team members switching classes before we started the project. We also are deciding on a way to communicate outside of school to work on our project. We are considering discord for the main method of communication.
