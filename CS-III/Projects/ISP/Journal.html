	<<h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>12-Jan-2023<b/></h5>
	     <b>Technical Challenges</b><br>
	     Figuring out how to use godot and implementing a suitable UI and map generating system.<br>
	     <b>Scheduling Challenges</b><br>
	     Balancing work on the project and other classes, as well as deciding who should work on what aspect of the game.<br>
	     <b>Interpersonal Challenges</b><br>
	     We needed to decide who would be working on what aspect of the game, we took some time to select who would do what issue.<br> 
	    <h5 class="w3-text-white"> <b>6-Jan-2023<b/></h5>
	      <b>Technical Challenges</b><br>
	       Since starting the project we have only encoutnered a few technical challenges. Finding the right engine to create the game on was one of them. We ultimately decided on the Godot engine. Another challange was setting up github repositoriesso we could all work on the game. <br>
	       <b>Scheduling Challenges</b><br>
	       Finding time to work on the project is very challenging. Outside of school I work a parttime job, so I do not have much free time. I try to work in class as much as possible to combat this.<br>
	      <b> Interpersonal challenges</b><br>
	       The only interpersonal challange we have faced was one of our team members switching classes before we started the project. We also are deciding on a way to communicate outside of school to work on our project. We are considering discord for the main method of communication.
