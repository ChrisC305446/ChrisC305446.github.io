The term bias means the inclusion of prejudice in favor of or against one thing compared to another. A major factor that must be considered in the decision making process is the inclusion of biases. Biases alter a person's decision making process, often leading them to make irrational decisions. Rational decision making involves identifying problems, gathering information, contemplating and analyzing outcomes, and ultimately reaching a decision. When accounting for others' decisions, the effect of bias on this process must be considered.

  <br><br>
  
There are numerous types of biases that can impact the cognitive process. Each one can affect a person's judgment subconsciously. One of these biases is called anchoring. Anchoring bias presents a piece of information about something, and results in someone relying on, or “anchoring” their decision on it. The first piece of information affects a person's judgment on any subsequent pieces of information. An example of anchoring bias is a starting price for a product.  The initial offer made is a reference point for any other offers on the price. This bias can be avoided by thinking critically and having an open mind about all options available, not tunnel visioning on the initial offer.  Another type of bias is base rate bias. This bias is present when we ignore the general facts, or “base rate”, in favor of specific information that only supports one event. An example of this bias would be investors heavily focusing on new information while ignoring long going trends and patterns. This bias can be avoided by paying more attention to the general facts, not forgetting the base rate. Similar to the base rate fallacy is attentional bias, which describes how one's selective perception can affect their attention and decision making process. Practicing self awareness and focusing on objective facts can help you to avoid this bias.

When making decisions, choice can greatly impact one's thinking.  The amount of choices available can have different effects on decisions made. Choices give people a greater sense of control, and this increases motivation. A quote from Sheen Inyengar explains how motivation is gained from choice. “The more choices we have, the more we believe that we can identify and pick a choice that is the perfect expression of who I am and what I want. And so that's really the link between my desire to uniquely be known as a type of person and how choices are used to establish my uniqueness.” According to a study published by psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper, the more choices presented to customers, the more people stop and look at the product. For their experiment they used jam. When a larger variety of jam was placed out, more people stopped to look at the jams, however, it was when there were less options that more people actually purchased any jam. This study shows that more options may not always be the best choice. The value of choice must be taken into consideration when accounting for decision making processes.

	    In conclusion, there are many different types of biases that can affect our thinking. These biases can be subconscious and difficult to account for. However if one is knowledgeable on decision bias, they can make more rational decisions. People's decisions can also be influenced by the amount of choices they are offered. The decision making process can be influenced in many ways, and it is important to take different factors into consideration.
