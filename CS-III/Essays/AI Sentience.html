	Artificial Intelligence is a way for computers to mimic the decision making capabilities of the human mind. The AI uses problem solving, and appears to think for itself. Some even argue that these AI are sentient. Whether or not these programs can think for themselves or not, they have undoubtedly made great advancements in many industries. AI has continued to evolve for years, with breakthrough after breakthrough. With the advancement of these AIs, they could lead to a greater future for humanity.
      <br>
      <br>
	AI advancements over the years have provided many contributions to society. The problem solving capabilities make it able to perform tasks no regular machine or program could do, formerly limited only to the human mind. Artificial intelligence is used in schools and banks to teach children and determine loans. It is also used by the military in many weapons. Hospitals use artificial intelligence for clinical documentation, and management of medical records. It can also be seen in everyday life, such as Youtube recommendations, Facebook feeds, and other social media platforms.
      <br>
      <br>
	Currently the capabilities of AI is limited but still significantly benefits society. However in the future AI could accomplish even more. Factoring in the speed of AIs improvement, it could lead to new tools in the various industries. Cyber security can be improved with AI to the point where it can effectively battle most cyber attacks. The manufacturing industry would be streamlined, and its products given more quality with the help of artificial intelligence. Some even say AI will be able to cure diseases, and travel through space.
      <br>
      <br>
	Despite the opportunities presented by AI, downsides have been presented by skepticists. AI is commonly used in the form of “bots”. These bots are software applications that automatically run tasks on the internet. They are used in social media platforms, and many video games. Many of the comments you see on social media posts are generated by bots. With the advancement of AI, more and more photos, text and videos could be AI generated. The problem with this is that they can be used for malicious purposes. Misinformation can be easily spread with bots and AI generated posts. Targeted misinformation and other risks presented by AI need to be considered, but the benefits provided by AI should not be ignored.
      <br>
      <br>
	There are many examples of amazing things made by AI.  Systems such as GPT-3 which performs natural language tasks, or DALL-E 2 which produces images based on a given description. The accuracy of these systems can sometimes be frightening, which goes to show the potential of artificial intelligence.
